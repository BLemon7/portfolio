        <p>Welcome to my portfolio site. Here I have compiled the work I have completed the past two semesters. Primarily I would like to share my content from IXD103, where I have been establishing my brand identity. This includes visual identities such as my monogram, word mark, and visual mark.
            <br>
            <br> Also from this semester, I have my infographic and app tasks from IXD104.

                <h2>Monogram</h2>



                <section class="version1">

                    <p>Below you can see the monogram I designed based on my initials - BL. The overall shape is based on basic geometric shapes for a contemporary look. The colour scheme utilises purple to convey the mood of creativity and elegance on the first impression. I have created an all-black version for use against contrasting backgrounds. The two versions can be seen below.</p>

Baskerville printed works for the University of Cambridge and, although an atheist, printed a splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Society of Arts, who took the designs back to the newly-created United States, where they were adopted for most federal government publishing.</p>

                    <p>Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and ink production. He developed a technique which produced a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.</p>

                    <blockquote>“Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them. I formed to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had endeavoured to produce a set of types according to what I conceived to be their true proportion.”</blockquote>

                    <h2>Wordmark</h2>

                    <p class="uppercase">Here is my word mark, which hasn't abstracted far from my monogram. I have added horizontal text as I think it is very effective for letterheads and website headers. The font choice is Exo which I have incorporated into my brand identity. I feel the sans type is effective at maintaining the contemporary style which I have employed in my monogram.
                        <br>
                        <br> As with the monogram, I have created an all-black version for use against contrasting backgrounds. The two versions can be seen below.</p>

                    <h2>Visual Marque</h2>

                    <p>My visual mark is based upon a unique part of me - my surname! You may question why this particular lemon is purple. A regular, yellow lemon would clash with my identity's purple colour scheme, so my solution was to make this visual mark even more eye catching by maintaining the brand identity.</p>
